1. The difference between position:absolute and position:fixed is that absolute will make the element
position relative to its closest ancestor. Fixed however will make it relative to the users visible area 
of the webpage(viewport). This means that elements will stay at the same place regardless
if you scroll. I absolute, if i move the ancestor element, then the element with position:absolute will 
still stay in the assigned part of the ancestor element, even if you move the ancestor around or even resize it. If it doesnt have 
an ancestor it will use the document body as its ancestor

2.I would use :nth-child(x), where x specifices which number. For example 
since i would have to choose the third child i would use :nth-child(3).

<ol>
<li>Somebody</li>
<li>Once</li>
<li>Told</li>
<li>Me</li>
</ol>

Lets say i would want to make the third element inside this list red, which is the Told part
then i would use ol>li:nth-child(3){
    color:red;
}
